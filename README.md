## **Business Activities**

**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

Specifically the company is trying to increase liquidity and make funding moe accesible to private equity companies. Traditionally this has been considered an illiquid asset class and so investors in this space have been rather limited. The company hopes that by providing a more frictionless platform and thereby increasing liquidity, private equity firms will be able to access funds more easy and investors will benefit from owning a more liquid/tradable asset.

**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

The company would primarily focus on servicing the Venture Capial Hedge Funds and Private Equity Investors by providing a more easier platform for their clients to trade/transact. According to Ibis World, the Private Equity market in the United States is $294.1 billion as at 2022 and has seen a 5.8% annual growth rate from 2017-2022.

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilise?)**

Secusitize's main competitive advantage is that they are able to offer their clients an all in one fully fledged digital solution with the main advantages being:

* *Quicker transaction times, with the use of blockchain technology, trades can be settled in a single day compared to 60 days for traditional private funds.*
* *Smart Contracts which allow for more effiecient portfolio allocation from tokenized products, which also helps reduce the costs for fund managers.*
* *Able to offer clients secondary market trading via the company's Alterntive Trading Systems (ATS).*
* *Another impressive advantage which the company once held was that in 2019, Securitize became the first Transfer Agent operating on blockchain technology registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).*

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?**

The company mainly utilizes blockchain technology and smart contracts to provide a platform for Private Equity nd Venture Capital Investors to trade. The company offers this via their Alernative Trading Systems (ATS).

## **Landscape**

**What domain of the financial industry is the company in?**

Essentially the Company providess a platform for investors to meet and trade and thereby acts as an exchange or marketplace for private equity investors. 
The company provides enhanced services and promotes trading in the alternative private equity asset class.

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5â€“10 years?**

With the introduction of FinTech into the traditional banking and investment management industries, we have seen a significant improvement in the processing of trades, specifically with regards to the settlement time. Payments have been made much easier and customers are not only used to quicker transaction times but also a more user friendly interface. The private equity market which has traditionally been slow and illiquid is now catching up with the reset of the financial sector. Accordingly the main trends in the private equity sector has been:

* *Increased liquidity*
* *Quicker processing times*
* *Improved transparency and regulations*
* *Lower costs on transactions*
* *Establishment of a secondary market with the trading of digital assets* 

**What are the other major companies in this domain?**

* *BitMart - offers a digital asset trading platform, with a focus on cryptocurrency.*
* *Gemini - A licensed digital asset exchange and custodian for both retails and institutional investors.* 
* *Polymath - Developers of a tokenized platform aimed at facilitating the issuance and trading of digitized assets.*

## **Results**

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

Securitize Inc has opened up a new avenue for venture capital and private equity funds to invest in and trade in securities. By utilizing the blockchain technology
the company has added depth, transparency and security to the market and has ultimately made it more accesible for financial institutions and market particpants. In addition trading costs and settlement time for these assets have been significantly reduced to the benefit of all market participants.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?**

There are a few metrics that can be used to measure the success of the company. The first would be the amount and number of rounds which the company successfully obtained funding. To date, Securitize Inc has raised a total of $100.2m in funding over 9 rounds with the last round being a Series B round on 21 June 2021. Another metric would be the number of acquisitions made by the company, which for me is a sign the momentum and growth of the company. In total, Securitize Inc has acquired 3 organizations with the most recent acquisition being that of Pacific Stock Transfer Company on Feb 22, 2022. The last metric that could be used I would say would be the numbers of customers the company has and is again an indication of the growth and size of the company. As of the last acquisition, the company now has in excess of 1.2 million investor accouns and generates around $6 million annually in revenues which suggestions a very healthy and growing company.

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?**

Since Securitive were the first digital transfer agents registered with the SEC, they had a first entry advantage and as such are doing much better relative to their competitors. Their closest and most similar competitor would be Polymath which generates around $5m in revenue annually and has generated funding of around $58.7m dollars.

## **Recommendations**

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)**

There is illiquidity and a thin secondary market in other asset classes as well. Most notably in the fixed income or bond market where unlisted bonds suffer from the same or similar shortcomings to that in the private equity space. With this in mind, my advice to Securitize Inc would be to expand their offering to provide for the tokenizing or digitizing of unlisted bond securities as well.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

The main benefit would be that it would increase the breadth of products that it could offer its clients. In addition, in the capital markets, companies generally  raise capital through issuing both debt and equity securities, so including bonds in their offering will accomdate for this and give more flexibility and options to private equity firms and would more suitably cater to their needs.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilise?**

This additional product would leverage off the existing blockchain technology (and platform) that Securitize currently utilize. Essentially the unlisted bonds would be tokenized and converted into a digital security to be traded on the companies Alternative Trading Systems.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

Simply, it would enhance the transparency, efficiency and breadth of the private equity and unlisted bond space. It would reduce cost, the occurences of failed trades and most importantly, it would provide liquidity and reduce the time taken to settle trades, which promotes a more robust market and gives confidence to investors.
